 Similarity Checking from Books
 Overview
This project analyzes 64 classic books using advanced algorithms to uncover patterns and similarities across texts.

✨ Highlights
 • Extracts the 100 most significant words.
 • Creates a 64x64 similarity matrix.
 • Identifies the top 10 most similar book pairs.
 • Precisely processes raw text with robust algorithms.

📊 Key Findings
 • Gerard’s Herbal: 91% similarity between Vol. 3 and 4.
 • Memoirs of Laetitia Pilkington: Consistent narrative across volumes.
 • Foxes Book of Martyrs: Maintains thematic focus.

🛠 Technical Details
 • Built in C++ with statistical comparison methods.
 • Processes 64 books with 2,016 pairwise comparisons.
 • Outputs word frequency analysis and similarity rankings.

🚀 How to Use
 1. Clone the repository.
 2. Add text files to the specified folder.
 3. Compile and run the code.
 4. Check output files for results.

📝 Outputs
 • common_words.txt: Top 100 words.
 • similarity_matrix.txt: 64x64 matrix.
 • similar_books.txt: Closest book pairs.

💡 Note
The program uses a stable, single-threaded design for consistent results.
